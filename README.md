#voglc21

..pronounced "vogulseetoowon", is a "very ordinary GL-like" library for graphics. If you've not used it before, then don't: you'll be much better of starting from scratch using openGL. However, if you've got old code which uses the vogl libraries, then this project might help you port it to a modern Linux system like Ubuntu.
